## ⚠ WARNING ⚠
- This tool is only meant for personal and private use!<br>
- I originally created it to download tutorials for school to watch while offline and without access to the internet.<br>
- There are **NO Safeguards** in place so your IP and device information is right open and accessible by YouTube and Google!<br>

⚠ Downloading YouTube videos can violate YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on how you use it. This is generally okay for personal backups, offline viewing of your own content, or content you have permission to download, or in my case only for personal-use.<br>
⚠ **Don’t redistribute stuff you don’t own - it's ILLEGAL!!** ⚠<br>
⚠ **DO NOT USE THIS TOOL TO TRAIN GEN-AI MODELS!! >:(**
